# Advent of Code: 2021

This marks my second year participating in [https://adventofcode.com/]( Advent of Code). I took part last year as well (see <https://github.com/ryan-heslin/aoc2020>. This time, I've taken a lot more care to organize solutions and inputs. I use both R and Python. For one puzzle, my "language" was
pen, paper, cut-up sticky notes, and human cognition, which made it easier to solve
than implementing a real solution with [A*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm).
Perhaps I'll do it properly at some point.

I solved most of the easier puzzles unassisted, but I sought help from others for some of the harder ones. While I always wrote code from
scratch, I sought help for a few of the harder puzzles:

* algmyr from the Python Discord gave me useful hints for days 16 and 24
* Several users from the [AoC subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/) helped me with day 22, and I used a set theory approach outlined by redditor Deynai.
