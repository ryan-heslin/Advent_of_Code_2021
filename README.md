# Advent of Code: 2021

This marks my second year participating in [ https://adventofcode.com/ ]( Advent of Code). I took part last year as well (see <https://github.com/ryan-heslin/aoc2020>. This time, I've taken a lot more care to organize solutions and inputs. I use both R and Python.

I solved most of the easier puzzles unassisted, but I sought help from others for some of the harder ones. While I alawys wrote code from
scratch, I sought help for a few of the harder puzzles:

* algmyr from the Python Discord gave me useful hints for days 16 and 24
* Several users from the [AoC subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/) helped me with day 22, and I used a set theory appraoch ooutlined by redditor Deynai.
